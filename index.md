Hanging as a form of capital punishment was not commonplace in 20th centruy Alexandria, Egypt. According to Nigel Cawthorne in his article "Public Execution: From Ancient Rome to Present Day," the most popular form of public execution was beheading, particularly with an axe (Cawthorne 2012). However, in Alexandria, Egypt in the year 1907, two people were publicly hanged for murder.The newspaper "The Egyptian Gazette" first announces the upcoming execution on May 10th, 1907 and later reports on the event on May 13th, 1907 as described in
[this student's blog post](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-squires/).

This rare occurrence of public hanging sheds light on a major historical event in 20th Century Alexandria, Egypt that speaks to growing Imperialist pressures called the Denshawai Incident where locals were sentenced to death by British officials after a perceived homicide of British soldiers, as described in Kimberly Luke's Article "Order or Justice: the Denshawai Incident and British Imperialism" (Luke 2007).

This incident was significantly different to the change in Imperialist measures the British, which extended its ruling through Lord Cromer who controlled Egypt as a statesman, were taking at the time. According to [this article](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/2016-10-24-british-imperialism/)by a previous student, the British were employing more liberal views on their rule such as self-determination.

 The local villagers were brought to trial "even before all the facts had been ascertained," as outlined in this article about Lord Cromer's rule titled "Lord Cromer: Practitioner and Philosopher of Imperialism" by Robert L. Tignor (Tignor 1963). The capital punishment inflicted during the Denshawai Incident goes against this new Imperialist perspective.
